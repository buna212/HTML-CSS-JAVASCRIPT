               It was born—a fragrance for the bold, the adventurous, and the dreamers who live life in full color. <br>
               The brand's founder, buna , wanted to create something different,
                a perfume that fused the timeless elegance of Paris with the energy of today's world. 
                perfume boutique is not just a scent; it’s a statement. It’s a fragrance for those who dare to stand out.</p>

Inspired by her grandmother's love for florals and the cutting-edge creativity of Parisian art and fashion, Camille set out to craft something that felt like the perfect balance between tradition and innovation. From the first drop, Lumière was designed to be a sensory experience that moved with you, not just a fragrance you wore.</p>
